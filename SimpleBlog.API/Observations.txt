I observed the below points:

API Side :
1. Need to use re-usable code.so we can improve the performance.
2. Permissions are must for the better security (like user management).
3. Json data should be always secured.
4. Need to use style cop for comments.

Front End Side:
1. Need to use stylesheet for the bettet UI
2. The response error payloads having the correct error messages but some response we can handle through AJAX calls
3. Routing session need to be taken for optional parameters.
4. Allignment changes are required.
